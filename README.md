# WebConsole #

## A web console written in HTML DOM Javascript and Node.js ##

Pretty much my biggest project to date. Works completely at least on Chrome & Firefox, untested in every other browser (scripts probably will work unless you use Internet Explorer, but the styling might be off)

## Installation ##

Just clone the repository or download the WebConsole tarball, go to the downloaded folder (or untar the tarball in a folder of your choice if you downloaded that way), open a console in the folder and type "npm install" and "nodejs main.js" (or "node main.js", depending on your Node release) in that order. After that, go to "localhost:8000" in Chrome. Commands are typed at the bottom box, and they are run by pressing enter. You'll need Node.js for this to work; You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

There's no need for command documentation / anything else as the program has sufficient help for all of the commands.
